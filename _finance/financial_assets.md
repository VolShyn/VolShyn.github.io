An asset is any resource owned or controlled by a business or an economic entity. It is anything (tangible or intangible) that can be used to produce positive economic value. 

# Financial assets

Category of assets that don't have a physical form but represent a claim to future cash flows or ownership in an entity. Their value comes only from the contractual agreements. We can think of them as of promises of future financial benefits.

<sub> **Cash flow** - payments made into / out of a business. Mostly used to describe payments that are expected to happen in the future. <sub>

Types:
* Cash / Cash equivalents
* Ownership in a company
* Bonds
* Derivatives, like options and futures
* Foreign currencies

<sub> Cash (coins, bills) has a physical form, however, it's still a financial asset, because its value doesn't come from the materials used (paper, metal) but from its role in the monetary system. <sub>


One key point of financial assets is that they are more **liquid** than physical assets. This means some can easily sell them and convert them into cash.

**Risk** differs from type-to-type of financial asset. They can be either low-risk or high-risk. Moreover, **returns** will change depending on the risk, from low but stable returns to high but unstable. 

On the other hand there are some other types of assets:

* Physical (real), like land, buildings
* Intangible, like intellectual property
* Human capital, as skills, experience
