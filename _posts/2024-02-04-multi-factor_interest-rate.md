# Multi-factor models
## Longstaff-Schwartz Model: 
Two-factor model incorporating both mean reversion and stochastic volatility, better capturing some real-world features.

## Chen Model: 

Three-factor model including mean reversion, stochastic volatility, and a factor for long-term rates, offering detailed dynamics but with increased complexity.

## Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) Model:

 Models the entire forward interest rate curve rather than just the short rate, providing a comprehensive framework but computationally demanding.
